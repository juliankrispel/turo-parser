## Turo parser

An attempt to rewrite the turo parser with the nearley parser generator

### Things I'm thinking about regarding the design

- Units and variables should be reactive (think spread sheet programming)
- Exposing an api for updating units/variables asynchronously
- The parser should be lightweight
- Should the parser only be a backend, so we don't reveal our IP?
- We should use the streaming system for suggested inputs and autocomplete
